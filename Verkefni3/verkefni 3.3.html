                        I never use cussing in 22 years - but the gloves are off. Listen you son of a bitch. What the fuck's your problem? You wanna sit here and say that I'm a goddamn fucking Russian? You get in my face with that I'll beat your goddamn ass you son of a bitch. You piece of shit. You fucking goddamn fucker. Listen fuckhead, you've fucking crossed the line. Get that through your goddamn fucking head. Stop pushing your shit. You're the people who've fucked this country over and gangraped the shit out of it and lost an election, so stop shooting your mouth off claiming that I'm the enemy. You got that you goddamn son of a bitch. Fill your hand, I'm sorry but I'm done. You start calling me a foreign agent, those are fucking fighting words, excuse me.﻿

                        Dudes, I think I cracked the code. The government isn't actually turning the frogs gay. Instead the government has been saving us from the alt right. Gay frogs is just a code phrase. Think about it wouldn't the government have silenced Daddy Alex Jones if he was spreading the truth? So I theorized that the government has leaked the code phrase to Alex Jones so that he could spread the message of gay frogs. This message would have taken all the alt right outs hiding by having them all joke about how Pepe is gonna turn gay, everyone else would have just ignored it as a crazy man rambling. So while everyone diverts their attention to actual frogs becoming the government begins turning the alt right gay. Effectively saving us from ourselves
